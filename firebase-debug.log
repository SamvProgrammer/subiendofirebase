You're about to initialize a Firebase project in this directory:

  /Users/samvprogrammer/Documents/ENSEÑANDO/subiendoapp

Before we get started, keep in mind:

  * You are initializing within an existing Firebase project directory

[info] 
=== Project Setup
[info] 
[info] First, let's associate this project directory with a Firebase project.
[info] You can create multiple project aliases by running firebase use --add, 
[info] but for now we'll just set up a default project.
[info] 
[info] i  .firebaserc already has a default project, using prueba1-74a35.
